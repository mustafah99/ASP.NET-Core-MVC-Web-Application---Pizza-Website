ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application - Pizza Website
Same as my Pizzeria Placeholder Website but I'm using a database for the Pizas and a built-in API with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE and JWT Token for Authentication.

Inside there is a console application / Pizza Console Manager for ASP .NET MVC Application Pizza Website using JWT Token Authentication.
